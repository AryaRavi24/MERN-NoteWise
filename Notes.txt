Mongoose :-
Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. 
It provides a schema-based solution for modeling application data and interacting with MongoDB databases.


 install Mongoose from the command line using npm:
    npm install mongoose --save


MongoDB
-----------------------
copy password 
copy connection string
Network access -> IP access list ->Add IP address -> Allow access from anywhere ->Confirm
Clusters -> Browse Collection

mongodb+srv://aryaravi2022:g2GvDCwgt8JBuk9V@cluster0.0saihtb.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0
here before ? we should add our db name.

install dotenv package for accessing environmental variables  


Middleware
-----------------------------------
It is a function that runs in the middle between request and response.

use cases:
authentication check
rate limiting

Rate limiting:
-------------------------
-It is a way to control how often someone can do something on a website or app like how many times they can refresh a page,
make a request to an API, or try to log in.
-Only 100 requests per user every 15 minutes.

-Preventing abuse(eg., stopping someone from aking 100 login attempts in a minute)
-Protecting servers from getting overwhelmed.

upstash - for rate limiting
    npm i @upstash/ratelimit@2.0.5 @upstash/redis@1.34.9


Daisy.UI - Tailwind library
    npm i daisyui@4.12.24 -D

for success and error notification 
    npm i react-hot-toast

for icons:
     npm i lucide-react

for fetching data :
    npm i axios

CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
----------------------
- It is a browser security rule.
-When a website tries to get data from another website
-like our frontend calling an API on a different domain- the browser might block it for security reason

Eg.,
I have fronend at http://localhost:5173

and an API backend at http://api.eample.com

Your frontend makes a fetch request to get data:
fetch('http://api.exmaple.com/users)

But the browser says :
You're coming from localhost:5173, and you're trying to access api.example.com
That's a different origin. I need to make sure the API allows this.
